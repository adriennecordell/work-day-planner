# Challenge Project #5

## Description
- This challenge assignment is a simple app that allows you to schedule things into your work day. Once you have added events they should stay on the page even when you refresh the browser. 

## Usage
To use the app simply click on the boxes to the right of the hour you would like to add an event to and once done typing the event click the blue save button to the right of the text box to save the event to local storage! 


## Credits

This project would not be possible without the starter code for the website. As a beginner web developer, I have minimal understanding of these coding languages. The starter code allowed me to focus on particular challenges and fixes while looking at already executed code to help guide me.

This project would have been a lot more difficult without the help of several people who have answered questions on Stack Overflow
